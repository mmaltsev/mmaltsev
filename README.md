<h1> Hi, I'm Maxim 👋 </h1>

I build **developer tools and API-first products**.

I’m a **Senior Product Manager** with 5+ years of experience working on **developer platforms, open-source tooling, and B2B SaaS** and 10+ years in software engineering and analytics.

Most of my work is close to engineering: clear product strategy, strong DX, and scalable systems. I’ve shipped **libraries, CLIs, SDKs, extensibility frameworks, and API-first services** used by developers and partners at scale.

**What I work on**

- Developer tooling: SDKs, CLIs, APIs, extensibility frameworks
- API-first SaaS platforms and ecosystems
- Product strategy, roadmaps, and prioritization
- UX for developers and design systems
- Cross-functional delivery in Agile environments
- Open-source products and communities
